What is the static type of m1? What is its dynamic type?
Static type is Message, dynamic type is Email.

Which method is called? Why?
The method from the dynamic type is called, because is one is saved in heap.

Why canâ€™t send() be called directly?
Because send() is not in the static type Message, so Compiler is not sure that this method exists.

How could you safely call send() anyway (e.g. instanceof)?
Downcast or use instanceof, see A2_Main.java.
